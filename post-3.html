            I went parasailing this past February! I am terrified of heights so
            I didn’t think that this was an activity that I would have ever
            agreed to do in my life, and I was okay with that. However, my
            oldest sister really wanted to do it for her birthday and my older
            sister was very excited about it. When it came time to buy the
            tickets I ended up agreeing just before they entered their card info
            so that I didn’t have any time to change my mind. We rode a boat out
            into Waikiki beach together with another party of a mom and her what
            seemed like a 5 year old daughter.

            The water was beautiful and the sun was shining, leaving little
            sparkles on the ocean surface. I even spotted a whale a few times
            for the first time in my life. The journey to the parasailing area
            was so calming and beautiful that it took my mind off of being
            lifted 100 feet above the ocean. My sister, my younger brother, and
            I were the first ones to go up, so they strapped us all together and
            braced us. You don’t feel it. The weird stomach feeling that you get
            on a rollercoaster or from landing/lifting off in a plane. It wasn’t
            sudden or scary at all going up. It was slow and careful and the
            higher you went, the smaller and lighter you felt. The world seemed
            so big and my problems at the time didn’t really matter. I wasn’t on
            Earth for 20 minutes.
          </p>

            It was a beautiful experience, floating 100 feet in the air, looking
            at the calm water, and even having a little conversation with the
            people you go up with, that is if you go up with people, I’d imagine
            getting bored just being up there alone (that’s how unscary it is).
            When we got back down we brushed the water and the landing was just
            as delicate as going up. After we got back into the boat, I watched
            everyone else do it, even the little girl, and realized that
            parasailing is only terrifying in my head and that it was actually
            really fun and peaceful. I think I’d enjoy overcoming my fears more
            often.
