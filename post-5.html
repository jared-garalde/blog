            I am a first-generation Filipino-American. I have had the privilege
            to pursue higher education because of my parents who immigrated here
            from the Philippines in the 1970’s. Since I was born, I was always
            encouraged to be true to myself and pursue the things that made me
            happy. I recognize that this is a privilege that not many people get
            to experience. However, that is why I am so passionate about giving
            back to underrepresented communities. I believe that if I, a 5’6”
            brown man, can create a meaningful impact in my field while battling
            the struggles of identity, racism, and mental health, it will
            inspire others to do the same. I was not always proud of being
            Filipino, or Asian for that matter. Growing up in a predominantly
            white community, the only connection to my heritage was through my
            family. I would be teased for my height, the color of my skin from
            my friends who were white, and I would be teased for being too
            “white-washed” from my friends who were minorities. I had no sense of 
            identity, and the concept of being proud of where I was from was
            something that did not often occupy my mind.
          <p>
            This lack of identity contributed to my experience with mental health, something I have
            struggled with since I was in high school. I was diagnosed with
            clinical depression at 18, and attention deficit hyperactivity
            disorder at 21. This was something that I had trouble acknowledging
            for a long time. I would only tell my closest friends and family. I
            had attempted suicide twice. Those experiences, however, motivated
            me to regain control of my life. This started my journey of
            self-acceptance, and I began to take small steps and implement
            strategies that would help me find joy and purpose. 
            
            One of the strategies I would use was to list things I was good at. I’ll admit,
            this was hard to do at first, but two of the qualities I came up
            with stuck with me. The first was that I was knowledgeable in
            technology and programming, and second, I had an eye for art and
            design. Naturally, I began to turn to these as an avenue to bolster
            my positivity and attitude toward my life. I immersed myself in
            design, filling sketchbooks and researching new methods. I explored
            different avenues, such as web design, illustration, painting,
            sculpture, and music. I loved discovering new ways to express
            myself. I discovered communities that shared the same interests as
            me. When I came to college, I was once again faced with a similar
            situation as when I was growing up. Washington State University is a
            predominantly white institution, and although I made lifelong
            connections my first semester, I felt like there was something I was
            missing.

            In my second semester, I found that something in the
            Filipino-American Student Association (FASA). I was introduced to
            people I related to on a level that I had never experienced before.
            I was learning more about my culture than I ever had before. I was
            attending events that celebrated my culture and sharing those
            experiences with others. I was, and am, proud to be
            Filipino-American. My involvement in FASA introduced me to the
            greater multicultural community through the Office of Multicultural
            Student Services on the fourth floor of our union building. I would
            spend probably 70% of my college experience there. I met a diverse
            range of students with different stories and experiences, some
            similar, and some vastly different from mine. I found mental health
            support groups that I could speak openly about my experiences with
            depression and suicide. I would attend events from held by
            organizations ranging from the Black Student Union to the Gender
            Identity and Sexual Orientation Resource Center. Just as I was proud
            to share my own culture, other people were as well. The more and
            more I became involved, the more I became motivated to pursue
            leadership in these organizations. I began to realize that despite
            my own love for these communities on campus, many people did not
            know about them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The issues that faced these organizations were complex and dynamic,
            and I constantly had to learn more and meet new people to gain a
            better understanding of them. I wasn’t a great leader and could
            barely speak in front of an audience. However, the support I got
            from my peers was unprecedented. They pushed me to pursue positions
            such as President of my Asian-based fraternal organization, Vice
            President of the Filipino-American Student Association in Pullman,
            and Public Relations for the Asian-Pacific American Student
            Coalition. I began reaching out past campus on a state and national
            level. I began involving myself with the Be the Match program as a
            student representative, as well as the Filipino American Historical
            Society. The more people I would meet, the more my conviction grew
            to bring awareness to these groups so they could help someone
            struggling with their identity like I was. I began to apply my
            experiences in leadership and community involvement in my education.
            I would gear my projects toward solving issues of underrepresented
            communities. This ultimately led me to combine my interests in
            design, technology, and community involvement, in a career goal in
            user experience. It was a perfect and natural fit for me, and I
            would independently educate myself in any way I could.
