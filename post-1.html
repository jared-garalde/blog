            Did you know that there are over 5,000 known species of frogs that
            can be found on every continent but Antarctica? And every day
            scientists discover more and more. Frogs are amazing.

            When I was 9 years old, I was walking home with my older sister
            after a day full of rain.

            We got close to train tracks and out of nowhere, my sister stopped
            walking and stared at the puddle of mud we were next to I wasn’t
            entirely sure what she was doing at first but she told me to run
            home (we were a 2 min walk away), get a container, and run back.
            Being the younger sibling I was, I did it without question. And when
            I got back she placed the tiny creature she had picked up while I
            was gone, and placed it into the container along with sticks,
            plants, and more mud. That creature was a frog, no larger than a
            pea. I loved that little guy. Sadly, his life didn’t last very long
            after because we were just kids and didn’t know how to properly care
            for one.

            I’m 24 now and have a partner who just got her B.S. in wildlife
            ecology. She teaches me about all kinds of animals now, but she
            especially likes frogs. She actually might love frogs more than I do
            and we send each other pictures of them every time we find them. I
            adore the creatures so much more now, and I understand their role in
            the wild a little more. So much, that if I come across one after a
            rainy day, I’ll say hello and leave the little guy to carry on with
            his day.
